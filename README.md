# Personal Project - Dashboard

Pretty self explanatory, I'm making a dashboard for personal use down the line.

## Design goals

- [] Make elements drag and drop
- [] Make a CustomCard template that we use as a HOC maybe? i'm not sure yet

Incorporate To-Do list, something like a calendar, and other such stuff to help track goals for when I'm working on potential job stuff to track my tasks. Maybe have a trello inspired section?
